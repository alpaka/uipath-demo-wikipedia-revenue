# Wikipedia Revenue demo
This is a very simple demo for the [UiPath RPA](https://www.uipath.com/) software. This demo searches with google for a number of search terms given in SearchTerms.xlsx (after appending "wiki") and reads some information from the Wikipedia page. This information is written back into the Excel sheet

Requirements:
- Chrome with UiPath extension
- Excel
